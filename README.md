# Retail Site Selection Analytics

**A. Project Overview**

This project analyzes the sales, profit and occupancy rate for an convenience storechain using Power BI. The focus is on identifying hols operational gaps, uncovering opportunities for optimization and providing insights to guide future performance forecasting.
For this project, the company strategy is prioritize development in adjacent or secondary cities to diversify beyond the saturated major hubs.
The outputs include: 
- A multi-page, interactive Power BI Dashboard.
- A set of in-depth analyses and actionable recommendations for business improvement.

**B. Dataset Information**

**Source**

- Synthetic dataset created for educational and portfolio purposes.
- The data structure and variables are designed to mirror real-world commercial leasing datasets in the retail sector in Vietnam.
- Geolocation coordinates are pre-generated within realistic city boundaries.

**Period**

- Lease start date in the range from 2019 - 2025, allowing analysis of both current and historical leasing performances as well as forecasting future result.

**D. Dashboard Structure & Key Insight**

**I. Overview**

**_Key Findings_**

- Strong Revenue vs Rent: Monthly Average Rent is 92.8M VND, while Monthly Average Sales reach 750.64M VND ‚Üí Profit margin before other expenses: 657.84M VND ‚Üí strong performance overall.
- Low Occupancy Rate: Average Occupancy Rate is 64.27% ‚Üí locations are only moderately attractive to customers ‚Üí still need to identify more bustling areas to boost natural foot traffic.
- Adequate Store Size: Average Store Area is 87.53 m¬≤ ‚Üí suitable for convenience store operations.
- Healthy Average Rent-to-Sales Ratio: Overall ratio is 12.36%, within the industry benchmark (‚â§ 15%).
  However, 2 specific stores (Active/Potential) show extremely high ratios of 65.56% and 79.73% ‚Üí high-risk locations. If other operating costs are considered, these stores have a high potential for deficit.

**_Actionable Insights_**

- Immediate Priority ‚Äì Increase Occupancy Rate: Target short-term initiatives to move closer to or above the 85% benchmark by prioritizing locations in high-density, high-foot-traffic areas.
- Address High-Risk Stores: For the 2 stores with 65.56% and 79.73% Rent-to-Sales Ratio ‚Üí initiate rent reduction negotiations or consider early closure if sales do not improve.
- Deeper Profitability Analysis: Current profit margin excludes labor, utilities, and service costs. A deeper cost analysis is needed to understand the net profitability.
- Dedicated High-Risk Analysis Page: Create a separate page in the dashboard to monitor, analyze, and track action plans for high-risk stores.

**II. Store Information**

_**Key Findings**_

- Current Footprint: The chain currently operates in 5 key cities: Hanoi, Hai Phong, Da Nang, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and Can Tho.
- Cost efficiency (Rent-to-Sales Ratio): Lowest in Can Tho (6.95%), Hai Phong (7.72%), and Da Nang (10.04%).
- Competition (Competitor Count): Fewest competitors in Can Tho (5.27%), Hai Phong (6.22%), and Da Nang (7.8%).
- Demand (Foot Traffic per Day): Lowest traffic in Can Tho (5.47%), Hai Phong (6.26%), and Da Nang (8.47%).
- Financial Performance Simulation:
  Assumed Operating Expense = 20% of Monthly Sales (industry-safe benchmark).
  Net Profit = Monthly Sales ‚Äì Rent ‚Äì Operating Expense.
  ROI = Net Profit √∑ Rent.
  Results:
  Highest profit (absolute): HCMC & Hanoi.
  Highest efficiency (ROI): Da Nang (854.07%), Can Tho (818.71%), Hai Phong (645.74%) ‚Äì ~1.5x higher than HCMC & Hanoi.

_**Actionable Insights**_

- Trade-off identified:
  Big cities (HCMC & Hanoi) ‚Üí Higher profit volume, but lower ROI (efficiency).
  Smaller cities (Da Nang, Can Tho, Hai Phong) ‚Üí Lower absolute profit, but much higher ROI, making capital deployment more efficient.
- Using the Site Expansion Decision Matrix and Priority Level (for more details: "Appendix" section): Da Nang emerges as both ‚ÄúPilot‚Äù and ‚ÄúStrong‚Äù candidate.
- Decision: Prioritize Da Nang for the next expansion.

_**Key Findings**_

- ~85% of stores need restructuring (Optimize/Close)

**_Actionable Insights_**

- Close: Exit 127 stores to cut costs.
- Optimize: Improve 94 stores via cost control, rent renegotiation, and CX upgrades.
- Keep: Protect 38 top stores.

**III. Appendix**

**1. Site Expansion Decision Matrix**

_This framework evaluates potential cities for new store openings by combining ROI (Return on Investment), Market Size (Foot Traffic), and Strategic Fit._

_**1.1. Segmentation**_

**_ROI (Return on Investment)_**

Absolute cut-off:
- ROI < 100% ‚Üí Not considered (below minimum hurdle).
- ROI ‚â• 100% ‚Üí Eligible for benchmarking.
Based on dataset min‚Äìmax after cut-off:
- Low ROI: min ‚Äì 1/3 range
- Medium ROI: 1/3 ‚Äì 2/3 range
- High ROI: 2/3 ‚Äì max

_**Market Size (Foot Traffic)**_

Based on dataset min‚Äìmax:
- Low: min ‚Äì 1/3 range
- Medium: 1/3 ‚Äì 2/3 range
- High: 2/3 ‚Äì max

(Thresholds automatically adapt to the dataset, ensuring fair comparison between cities.)

_**1.2. Site Expansion Decision Matrix**_

**_Step 1: ROI √ó Market Size Matrix_**

| ROI ‚Üì \ Market ‚Üí | Low Market Size | Medium Market Size    | High Market Size |
